    description:
      "Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) is a discipline that combines the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML) to automate traditional IT operations (such as event correlation, anomaly detection, and causality determination). It is designed to help organizations better manage their IT infrastructure, reduce downtime, and optimize system performance. AIOps provides IT teams with a unified view of their entire IT environment and automates many of the routine tasks associated with monitoring and managing complex IT systems to free up their critical resources by automating low and high-value tasks.",
